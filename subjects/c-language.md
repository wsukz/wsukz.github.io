## üì¶ Weekly Assignments via GitHub Classroom

- Weekly assignments are released through [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/219947495-pbl-c-language).
- Each assignment is project-based and tied to that week's lecture topic.
- Students must:
  - Clone the assignment repository
  - Complete the task within **7 days**
  - Push the code back to GitHub for **autograding**
- Assignments are graded automatically, but students must be prepared to **explain their code** during office hours or class.

### ‚úÖ Allowed Tools
- You may use **AI coding assistants** (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) **only** for **learning purposes**.
- **Copying or plagiarism** is strictly prohibited. Your work must reflect your own understanding.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Weekly Contests via Codeforces

- After each lecture, a **2-hour contest** is hosted on [Codeforces](https://wsukz.contest.codeforces.com/).
- Each contest includes:
  - **5 problems**
  - Designed with **IOI-style evaluation**
  - Total score: **500 points**
- Problems are directly tied to the week‚Äôs lecture topic (e.g., loops, arrays, strings, functions, etc.)
- Codeforces scores account for **50% of your total grade**

### ‚ùå Restrictions
- **No AI/NLP tools** (like ChatGPT or Copilot) are allowed during contests
- Contests are open-book but must be solved **individually**
