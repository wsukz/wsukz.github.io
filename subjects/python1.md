# 🐍 Introduction to Python Programming

Welcome to the **Python Programming course** at Woosong University Kazakhstan — a fast-paced course designed to build practical programming skills and prepare students for backend development, data science, and AI applications.

This course builds on your **C programming foundation** and focuses on writing clean, efficient Python code through **competitive programming** and **project-based learning**.

---

## 📦 Weekly Projects via GitHub Classroom

Starting from **Week 9**, assignments are released through  
[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/219947495-pbl-c-language).

Each assignment is a **backend or API-based project** connected to that week’s topic.

Students must:
- Clone the assignment repository  
- Complete the project within **7 days**  
- Push the code back to GitHub for **autograding**
- Be ready to **explain their implementation** if asked

### ✅ Allowed Tools
- AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) may be used **only for learning and debugging**
- You must understand and be able to explain every line of your code
- **Copying full solutions or plagiarism is strictly prohibited**

---

## ⏱️ Weekly Contests via Codeforces

Every week (Weeks 1–12), after the lecture, students participate in a **60-minute contest** on  
[Codeforces](https://wsukz.contest.codeforces.com/).

Each contest includes:
- **3 problems**
- IOI-style evaluation
- Total score: **300 points**
- Problems are directly tied to lecture topics (Python syntax, loops, data structures, etc.)

### ❌ Restrictions
- **AI/NLP tools are NOT allowed during contests**
- Contests must be solved **individually**
- Internet is allowed only for **official documentation**

Codeforces performance accounts for **50% of your total grade**.
